		<p>Kindergram is a freemium application. Parents sign-up their children by using their own Facebook account to create a profile for their kids. Once the profile is created, parents always are kept advised by notifications about their kids' activities.</p>
		<p>Kids create artworks by using artwork apps among Kindergram app finder. When a kid selects a premium app, parents recieve an instant notification asking them if they agree to purchase it for their child.</p>

		<p>Kids like to follow other kids and take example from their artwork. By using the pinwheel button, kids share, save and organize artworks they like in their boards.</p>
		<p>The more a piece of artwork is pinwheeled by other kids, the higher it is rated on the popular page. It's stimulating to get followers. Artwork starts to be intentional. Kids start to create Art. In any kid, there is an artist who wants to express talent and creativity. Kindergram is a playful way for kids to learn from others, to discover what they like, to get followers and to share positive feedback. It's a fun way for them to build their personality.
